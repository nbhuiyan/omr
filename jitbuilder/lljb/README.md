# LLJB

LLVM + JitBuilder = LLJB

# About

The LLJB project enables interoperability between LLVM and JitBuilder. LLJB
takes LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR) files and uses JitBuilder API to
construct equivalent OMR Compiler IL. The OMR Compiler then performs
optimizations and generates native code for every function in the module.

# Additional Requirements

You need the following to build lljb:

* clang 8.0
* llvm 8.0

### On macOS - using Homebrew

```
brew install llvm@8
```

### On Ubuntu
```
apt install clang-8 llvm-8 llvm-8-dev
```

## Enabling building LLJB

You must use the CMake build system to build LLJB. The following are
the options that must be enabled when configuring CMake build:

```
OMR_LLJB
OMR_JITBUILDER
OMR_COMPILER
```

## Enable Tests
